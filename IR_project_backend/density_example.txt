 Four students performed an experiment to calculate the density of a stone. 
            While measuring the mass of the stone with the help of spring balance, the first student immersed the stone in water, 
            the second student immersed it in sulphuric acid, the third student immersed it in kerosene and 
            the fourth student allowed it to hang freely in air. The correct value of mass of the stone will be obtained by   
            In this experiment, we need true value of mass that can be measured by suspending the stone freely in air.
            When we immerse the stone in some liquid, the liquid will exert an upward force on the stone in upward direction. 
            This changes the reading of the spring balance and we will not get the correct value.
