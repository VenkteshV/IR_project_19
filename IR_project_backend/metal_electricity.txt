How will you show experimentally that metals are good conductors of electricity
 Describe the extraction of copper metal fromÂ  its ore ,copper glance (Cu2s)

 answer
Experiment to show that metals are good conductors of electricity
Set up an electric circuit as shown in the figure below.

Take an iron nail and place it in the circuit between A and B terminals.
You will observe that the bulb glows at once. This shows that the iron metal conducts electric current (or electricity). Thus, the experiment shows that metals are good conductors of electricity.
The concentrated copper (I) sulphide is roasted in air when it is oxidised to copper (I) oxide.
